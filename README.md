# High-Performance X-Ray Classifier (ResNet50 Transfer Learning)



## üéØ Project Goal



This project aims to build a robust, high-performance system for the binary classification of **Chest X-ray images** to screen for signs of **Viral Pneumonia**. The primary objective is to maximize **Recall (Sensitivity)** on the positive class to ensure clinical safety by minimizing **False Negatives (FN)**‚Äîcritical in medical pre-screening applications.



***



## ‚ú® Key Findings



1. **Class Collapse Resolution:** Initial training failed (0% True Positives). This was solved by implementing a **Two-Phase Fine-Tuning Strategy** (Freezing ResNet50 layers, then unfreezing with an extremely low learning rate).

2. **High Clinical Sensitivity:** The final model achieved **93.1% Recall** on the test set, demonstrating reliability in correctly identifying patients with the condition.

3. **Threshold Optimization:** An optimal decision threshold of **0.700** was calculated and applied, moving away from the default $0.500$ to maximize the model's **Balanced Accuracy (89.3%)** for production deployment.

## üìä Results and Visuals (3 Figures Included)



The final model was evaluated on a dedicated test set, yielding the following performance metrics:



| Metric | Value | Interpretation |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Overall Accuracy** | 90.2% | High generalization ability on unseen data. |

| **Recall (Positive)** | 93.1% | High rate of finding actual positive cases (low FNs). |

| **Decision Threshold** | 0.700 | Optimized cutoff point for classification. |
